      <summary>What is the shipping time</summary>
      <p>
        Standard Shipment

        The shipping time for your order is estimated to be 2-3 working days. Please keep in mind that this is an approximate timeframe, and actual delivery times may vary depending on factors such as your location, shipping method, 
        and any potential delays that may occur during transit. If you have any specific concerns or need more precise information about your shipment, please don't hesitate to reach out to our customer service team for further assistance.<br>
        
        <br>Expedited Shipment<br>
        
        By default, we use FedEx for most expedited orders. With the battery items, we would ship with DHL.
        Normally, the expedited shipping will take around 17 days. Please take a note that the shipping time is an estimated time not proper shipping time. For now, NONE of delivery companies offer their shipping time guarantee service.
        
        
        If your order is over 3000rs, we highly recommend to purchase the expedited shipping. It is more safe and guaranteed.<br>
        
        
        <br> Still not receive?<br>
        
        "In our shipping experience, the longest delivery time for orders with free shipping within India typically extends to around 5-7 days. If your parcel hasn't reached you within this period after you receive the tracking information, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us. We're committed to resolving any issues you may encounter, which may include offering a refund or arranging for a reshipment. Please note that the 5-7 day window begins from the day you receive the tracking information, not from the day you initially place your order."
